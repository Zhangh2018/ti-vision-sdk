For running the other config test cases, please copy the respective test input images
to the relative location $testvecs\input folder and edit the config_list.txt to
enable running of config_0.txt to config_6.txt test case by changing "2" to "1".

NOTE: In config_list.txt, the first argument "1" implies run the test case, "2" implies
skip the test case & "0" implies end of test cases.
