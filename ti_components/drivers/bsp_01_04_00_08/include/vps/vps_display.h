/**
 *  \brief Display driver buffer program callback function prototype.
 *
 *  This callback is called by the driver when it is about to program the
 *  already queued buffer to the hardware. The driver returns the current
 *  frame pointer and the application can use this information to check if
 *  the buffer to be programmed is too old to display. If it decides so,
 *  the application can give a new frame buffer (blank frame) in the return
 *  parameter. Then the driver swaps this FVID2 frame pointer in it's internal
 *  queue and program the new frame provided.
 *
 *  Note: Once the frame is swapped with the driver, the driver will not have
 *  any reference to the old frame. The ownership of the old frame is
 *  transferred to application and will not be returned in the driver dequeue
 *  operation.
 *
 *  User should assume that callbacks happen in ISR context and hence should
 *  apply rules relevant to ISR context when implementing callback functions,
 *  i.e blocking APIs should not be called from callback. Users should also
 *  assume that interrupts are enabled when in callback context, i.e other
 *  interrupt / callbacks can occur when a callback is under execution.
 *  User callback implementation should not be very long, since callback
 *  execution may block other drivers from executing. Typically it is
 *  recommended to set a semaphore or flag when callback happens and do the
 *  more involved callback handling in task context.
 *
 *  \param handle       [OUT] FVID2 handle for which the callback has occurred.
 *  \param curFrm       [OUT] Current FVID2 frame about to be programmed.
 *  \param isFrmRepeat  [OUT] Flag to indicate whether the current frame is
 *                            already programmed in the hardware.
 *  \param creditCnt    [OUT] If frame repeat, this indicates the frame repeat
 *                            count reflecting the hardware queue depth.
 *                            In case of DSS, we have actual register and shadow
 *                            register. Hence this value could be 1 or 2
 *                            for most of the cases. 1 means normal operating
 *                            mode without frame repeat. 2 means both the
 *                            shadow and current register have the same buffer
 *                            i.e. the frame is getting repeated.
 *                            There is a special case when this value is 0.
 *                            This means the driver is trying to program the
 *                            register in low latency mode in task context.
 *                            But the success of the buffer getting accepted
 *                            depends on when the queue is called with respect
 *                            to VSYNC. If the Queue call is very near the VSYNC
 *                            say 10 lines before VSYNC, the buffer programming
 *                            will not be accepted. And the application should
 *                            assume that the buffer will gets programmed in
 *                            the next VSYNC only.
 *
 *  \return The application can return the new FVID2 frame to be used for
 *  programming the hardware. If the application returns NULL no action is
 *  taken and the driver will go ahead and program the current frame to
 *  hardware.

/**
 *  \brief Bypass low latency check IOCTL.
 *
 *  This IOCTL can be used to bypass the low latency check before programming
 *  the buffer to the hardware.
 *
 *  In order to support low latency display, the display driver provides a
 *  mechanism to program the buffer address in the Fivd2_queue() context. This
 *  will ensure that the recently given buffer is programmed directly in to the
 *  hardware register without waiting for the next VSYNC interrupt.
 *
 *  To avoid race condition between the hardware VSYNC occurring and the driver
 *  programming the buffer at the same time, the driver generally checks that
 *  the actual programming of the register is not near the VSYNC period.
 *  For this, the driver makes use of the current line count (relative to
 *  previous VSYNC) of the DSS hardware. But this hardware feature is not
 *  present for all the overlays/VENC. For example, for DSS LCD2 and LCD3, this
 *  feature is not present. Hence for these overlays, low latency display
 *  can't be supported using the above line check feature.
 *
 *  In order to work around this hardware limitation, the driver can bypass this
 *  "queue not near to VSYNC" check and let the application do this check using
 *  timestamp with respect to last VSYNC and the expected display FPS. To do
 *  so, application can check just before driver queue, that it is
 *  not near the (VSYNC period - 2 ms) and then queue the frame. From this point
 *  to the actual register programming takes less that 1 ms for the driver if
 *  no context switching happens. To ensure this the display task can be made
 *  the highest task in the system and other HWI events which take more than
 *  safe period (in this case 2ms).
 *
 *  This IOCTL is per display driver instance and hence should be called
 *  separately for each display pipeline.
 *
 *  Also this IOCTL should be called before starting the display.
