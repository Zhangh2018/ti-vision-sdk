/**
    @brief  Below DISPARITY_TI_OutputCostType enums define the type of cost values written by the function into the output buffer with identifier DISPARITY_TI_BUFDESC_COST_OUT
            Internally for each pixel P(i,j) with i=[0.., width-1] & j=[0.., height-1] up to numDisparities cost values are computed, thus producing an array COST(d,i,j) with d=[0,...,numDisparities-1] and i=[0,...,width-1], j=[0.., height-1].
            The function offers choices on what cost values can be written out to DISPARITY_TI_BUFDESC_COST_OUT. Each cost value is a 16-bit integer.

            Here are the output cost type supported:

            DISPARITY_TI_NOCOST: no output cost value is written into the buffer DISPARITY_TI_BUFDESC_COST_OUT.

            DISPARITY_TI_MINCOST: for each pixel, the cost value corresponding to the best disparity found is output. 
                                        The cost value can be characterized as the minimum cost value accross all disparities searched.
                                        So for every pixel P(i,j) what is produced is MINCOST(i,j)= COST(dmin,i,j)= min(COST(d,i,j)) with d varying from 0,.. to numDisparities-1 and for which minimum is attained at d= dmin.
                                        Note that dmin is different for every pixel and in reality is a function of i & j .

                                        The format of the output frame is:

                                        row 0:        MINCOST(0,0),        MINCOST(1,0), ....        MINCOST(width-1,0)
                                        row 1:        MINCOST(0,1),        MINCOST(1,1), ....        MINCOST(width-1,1)
                                        ...
                                        row height-1: MINCOST(0,height-1), MINCOST(1,height-1), .... MINCOST(width-1,height-1)

                                        In total width x height x 2 bytes are produced . 

            DISPARITY_TI_MIN_ADJACENT_COSTS: in addition to the minimum cost, adjacent costs are written out. 
                                                   Adjacent costs are defined as follow: if for a pixel P(i,j), COST(dmin,i,j) is the minimum cost corresponding to the best disparity then COST(dmin-1, i,j) and COST(dmin+1, i,j) are the 
                                                   defined as adjacent costs. Note that dmin is different for every pixel and in reality is a function of i & j .
