/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function calculates the perimeter of a blob. A pixel is considered to be on the border
 *  of the blob if at least one of its 4 closest neighbors (top, bottom, left, right) is not in
 *  the blob. In other words, if all 4 of these neighbors are in the blob, then it is NOT a border
 *  pixel. The perimeter is the sum of the border pixels.  If the blob has hole inside, then the perimeter
 *  of the hole is also counted.
 * 
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  ccmapColor   The ccmap color of the blob. The ccmap is one of the outputs of connected component labeling. (Q32.0)
 *    @param [in]  width        The width of the ccmap, used to calculate some internal offset  (Q32.0)
 *    @param [in]  blob_ii      The pointer to interval image of the blob                       (AVMii)
 *    @param [in]  pBlobMap     The pointer to ccmap of uint8_t type of data                    (Q8.0)
 *    @param [out] perimeter    The output address of the perimeter. The output is single word. (Q32.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be not aliased.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C66 floating-point processors
 *
 * @par Performance Notes:
 *      NA
