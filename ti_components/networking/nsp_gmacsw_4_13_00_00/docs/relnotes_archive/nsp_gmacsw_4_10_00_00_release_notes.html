    </h2>
    <p>
      This is an NSP release for the 3-port Gigabit Ethernet Switch (GMACSW) on the
      DRA7xx/TDA2xx (Vayu) device, the DRA62x (J5Eco) device, and the DRA65x/VisionMid (Centaurus)
      device. On J5Eco and Centaurus devices, this release supports Ethernet control on the 
      ARM Cortex-M3 (Media Controller) and ARM Cortex-A8 (GPP or MPU). On the Vayu device,
      this release supports use on the ARM Cortex-M4 (IPU) and ARM Cortex-A15 (MPU).
      Network examples for SYS/BIOS 6.x are provided for the supported cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Network Development Kit Support Package (NSP) contains&nbsp;
      ethernet driver code, libraries and network examples for the supported EVM platforms. 
      It is meant to be used in conjunction with the TI Network Development Kit
      (NDK), which consists of the platform independent networking code and stacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NSP product is comprised of the following main packages
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ti.nsp.drv</span>: Contains the NSP driver
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ti.ndk.vayu</span>: Contains the NDK example application for the DRA7xx/TDA2xx (Vayu) device
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ti.ndk.j5eco</span>: Contains the NDK example application for the DRA62x (J5Eco) device
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ti.ndk.centaurus</span>: Contains the NDK example application for the DRA65x/VisionMid (Centaurus) device
      </li>
    </ul>These driver packages are provided as source code and prebuilt libraries.<br>

    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for the CPTS timestamping module of the GMACSW hardware has been added.</li>
      <li>A top-level IOCTL interface has been added and defined for supporting various operations on the driver (including for the new CPTS module).</li>
      <li>Source and build has been modified to clearly separate the hardware-specific code from OS- and stack-dependent code. In cases where the NDK is not
      used, only the hardware driver library will be included in a build.
      </li>

      Information</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The method for registering a stack with the NSP driver has changed with new GMACSW_registerNetworkStack() and 
      GMACSW_unregisterNetworkStack() APIs. The GMACSW_startNetworkStack() and GMACSW_stopNetworkStack() APIs were also 
      added. These APIs were added as part of the effort to address OMAPS00301434 and OMAPS00300775.

      The NSP includes demonstration software which showcases the various devices
      and cores and their capabilities across a range of network enabled applications, using
      the SYS/BIOS 6.x RTOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NDK examples found in this NSP can serve as a rapid prototype platform
      for the development of network and packet processing applications, or to add
      network connectivity to existing applications for communications,
      configuration, and control. Using the components provided in the NDK and NSP,
      developers can quickly move from development concepts to working
      implementations attached to the network.
