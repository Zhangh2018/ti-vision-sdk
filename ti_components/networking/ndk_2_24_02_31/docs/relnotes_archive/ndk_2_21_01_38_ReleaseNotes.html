<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>


<p>
The Network Developer's Kit (NDK) is a platform for development
and demonstration of network enabled applications on TI embedded
processors,
currently limited to the TMS320C6000 family and ARM processors.
The code included in this NDK release is generic C code which runs
on any C64P, C66, C674, ARM9, Cortex-A8 or Cortex-M3 device (for C6000 processors,
both big endian and little endian modes are supported). Users
can obtain an appropriate NDK Support Package (NSP) for the various supported
platforms separately. The NDK Support Packages include demonstration
software
showcasing capabilities across a range of network enabled
applications. In addition, the stack serves as a rapid prototype
platform
for the development of network and packet processing applications, or
to add
network connectivity to existing applications for communications,
configuration, and control. Using the components provided in the NDK,
developers can quickly move from development concepts to working
implementations attached to the network. Please check the
<a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">
release website</a>
for previous release notes and NDK Support Packages.

<h2><a name="Whats_New">What's New</a></h2>


<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This is a patch release to NDK 2.21.00.32</li><li>Fixed configuration bug which caused incorrect DHCP Server code to be generated</li><li>Added
dependencies between protocol configurations (in ti.ndk.config package)

<ul><li>SDOCM00092360&nbsp;Code not generated properly for NDK config modules due to missing dependencies</li><li>SDOCM00093260 (Child) DNSGetHostByName function should return multiple IP addresses but only returns a single address</li><li>SDOCM00092317 Generated DHCP server code incorrect</li></ul><hr>
<h2><a name="Upgrade_Info">Upgrade Information</a></h2>

<p>
All the libraries in this release support either IPv4 or IPv6 (or both)
and NIMU. The low-level (LL) packet driver architecture has been
deprecated
since NDK v2.0.0 release.
</p>


<p>The NDK stack in this release supports SYS/BIOS 6.32.03.43 (or
greater) and is meant to be used with CCSv5.1. The OS Abstraction Layer
(OSAL) and HAL libraries
have been provided for SYS/BIOS 6.x only. &nbsp;DSP/BIOS 5.x support
can be found in previous versions of the NDK.
</p>


<p>
The latest Network Support Packages (NSPs) are now released independently of
this product and can be obtained from
the <a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">NDK website</a>.

<h2><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>


The NDK has been updated to take advantage of the new SYS/BIOS feature
which automatically deletes dynamically created Task objects which have
reached the terminated state. &nbsp;If your application configuration
is loading the package 'ti.ndk.config' and/or using the
'ti.ndk.config.Global.xdc' module, then Task clean up will be set up
correctly for you.<br><br>However, if your application configuration is
not loading the 'ti.ndk.config' package or the
'ti.ndk.config.Global.xdc' module, then you must add the following
lines of code to your application configuration (*.cfg) file:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">var Task = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.knl.Task');<br>Task.deleteTerminatedTasks = true;<br></div><br>If not, you may experience out of memory issues due to improper Task clean up. &nbsp;Please refer to section&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">5.2.2 TaskCreate(), TaskExit(), and TaskDestroy()</span> of the <a href="docs/spru523h.pdf">NDK User's
    Guide</a> for more information.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Known Bugs</span>:<ul>
<li>SDOCM00090817 - IPv6 init command fails sporadically</li>
<li>SDOCM00090372 -&nbsp;running ping to a host name within client telnet session does not work due to 
incorrectly resolved host name to IP address</li><li>SDOCM00075040 - running ping command within a telnet session on the ndk causes the terminal and telnet session to hang</li>

  <li>SDSCM00025064 - DSP crash on Reboot with a PPPoE server on NDK.
      Workaround: Ensure that the PPPoE server of the NDK stack is closed
      before rebooting the stack.
  </li>

  <li>SDSCM00024506 - PPPoE client connection handle is not removed after
  PPPoE session timeout. Workaround: Ensure that the session timeout on the
  PPPoE server is configured to be a large value to avoid this issue.
  </li>
  
</ul>

<h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks</a></h2>


<p>NDK benchmarks (described here: <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/spraaq5a/spraaq5a.pdf">Network Developer's Kit (NDK) Benchmark and Sizing</a>)
were re-built and run using the TCI6482/DSK6455 platform in order to
obtain throughput and CPU load information against NDK 2.21x libraries
(for NIMU architecture only).
</p>
<p>The benchmarks were run using the IPv6 enabled libraries
(stk6_nat_ppp_pppoe.a64P and libraries built with _INCLUDE_IPv6_CODE
defined), as well as the pure IPv4 only libraries
(stk_nat_ppp_pppoe.a64P and *_ipv4.a64P libraries), which most closely
resemble the previously published benchmark results for NDK 1.94
(linked above).
</p>
<p>During benchmarking, it was found that the IPv6 enabled stack
libraries caused increased CPU load when compared to the pure IPv4
case. This issue is currently under investigation.
</p>

<p>Please find updated Excel spreadsheets for benchmark results here.
You may compare them to the spreadsheets found in the zip file attached
to the aforementioned benchmark document: </p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h2>


<p>NDK examples are no longer included as part of the NDK core release.  All
   examples are now located in a seperate Network Support Package (NSP).
</p>
<p>
   This NDK release was validated using the latest NSP 1.10.00.03 product for the
   evmOMAPL138 and evm6748 and so works best with the examples found in that
   product. Users who have the evmOMAPL138 or evm6748 hardware platforms should
   make sure to use the latest NSP product with this NDK release.
</p>
<p>
   The latest NSP product may be downloaded from the
   <a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">NDK website</a>
</p>
<p>
   For all other hardware platforms, the corresponding NSP products and
   examples may be found in the previous NDK 2.00 and NDK 2.01.00 products,
   which are also found at the 
   <a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">NDK website</a>.

<hr>
<h2><a name="Rebuilding_The_Core">Rebuilding The NDK Core Libraries</a></h2>

<p>The NDK product includes source files and build scripts that allow the user to modify its sources and rebuild its libraries.
   You can do this in order to modify, update, or add functionality. If you<br>edit
the NDK source code and/or corresponding build scripts, you must also
rebuild the NDK in order to create new libraries containing these
modifications.</p><p>The NDK ships with a make file which may be used to rebuild the NDK libraries after sources have been modified.
</p>

<p>Please refer to the following web page for instructions on how to rebuild
   the NDK: <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Rebuilding_The_NDK_Core_Using_Gmake">Rebuilding The NDK Core With Gmake</a>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Version">Version Information</a></h2>

<p>
This product's version follows a version format, <b>M.mm.pp.bb</b>,
where <b>M</b> is a single digit Major number, <b>mm</b> is 2 digit
minor number, <b>pp</b> is a 2 digit patch number, and <b>b</b> is an
unrestricted set of digits used as an incrementing build counter.
</p>


<p>
To support multiple side-by-side installations of the product, the
product version is encoded in the top level directory,
ex. <b>ndk_2_21_01_38</b>.
</p>


<p>
Subsequent releases of patch upgrades will be identified by the patch
number, ex. NDK 2.20.01 with directory <b>ndk_2_20_01</b>.
Typically, these patches only include critical bug fixes.
