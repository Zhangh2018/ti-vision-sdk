    \file utils_buf_ext.h
    \brief APIs defined in this file are used by links-and-chains example
     to exchange buffers between two tasks

    Internally this consists of two queues
    - empty or input queue
    - full or output queue

    The queue implementation uses fixed size array based queue data structure,
    with mutual exclusion built inside the queue implementation.

    Optional blocking of Get and/or Put operation is possible

    The element that can be inserted/extracted from the queue is of
    type System_Buffer *

    The basic operation in the example is as below

    - When a producer task needs to output some data, it first 'gets' a
       empty buffer to output the data from the buffer handle.
    - The task outputs the data to the empty buffer
    - The task then 'puts' this data as full data into the buffer handle
    - The consumer task, then 'gets' this full buffer from the buffer handle
    - After using or consuming this buffer, it 'puts' this buffer as empty
      buffer into this buffer handle.
    - This way buffers are exchanged between a producer and consumer.
