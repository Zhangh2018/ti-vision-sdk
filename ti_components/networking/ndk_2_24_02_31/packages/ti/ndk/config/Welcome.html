        <form>
            <p>The Network Developer's Kit (NDK) is a platform for development and demonstration of network enabled applications on TI embedded processors, currently limited to the TMS320C6000 family and ARM processors. The code included in this NDK release is generic C code which runs on any C64P, C66, C674, ARM9, Cortex-A8 or Cortex-M3 device (for C6000 processors, both big endian and little endian modes are supported). The stack serves as a rapid prototype platform for the development of network and packet processing applications, or to add network connectivity to existing applications for communications, configuration, and control. Using the components provided in the NDK, developers can quickly move from development concepts to working implementations attached to the network.</p>

            <h1>Getting Started</h1>
            <form>
                <p>Navigate to the <a>System Overview</a> screen which depicts all of the components of the Network stack.
                You can add any of these components to your configuration by right-clicking on one and
                selecting "Use". You can configure any of the stack components by clicking on them, which will bring you to that component's configuration view.
                At minimum, two different views are then available to choose from:</p>
                <li style='text' value='1.'><b>Module.</b>  This view includes module configuration settings that most typically used.</li>
                <li style='text' value='2.'><b>Instance.</b>  Modules that support instances will have this view.  It includes tools to create instances and configure commonly used instance properties.</li>
                <li style='text' value='3.'><b>Advanced.</b>  This view always includes every configuration setting in a generic table format.</li>
                <p>Note that you may freely move between the different views, and selecting options in one view will immediately update the
                other views' settings. You may return to the initial home view at any time by clicking on the Home icon in the upper right
                corner of the config tool window. Note that various warnings about your configuration may appear in the CCS Problems window.
                If this window is not visible, you can make it so by selecting Window->Show View->Problems.</p>
