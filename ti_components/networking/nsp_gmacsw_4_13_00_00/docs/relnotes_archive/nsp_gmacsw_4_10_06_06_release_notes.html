    <p>
      This is an NSP release for the 3-port Gigabit Ethernet Switch (GMACSW) on the
      DRA7xx/TDA2xx (Vayu) device, the DRA62x (J5Eco) device, and the DRA65x/VisionMid (Centaurus)
      device. On J5Eco and Centaurus devices, this release supports Ethernet control on the
      ARM Cortex-M3 (Media Controller) and ARM Cortex-A8 (GPP or MPU). On the Vayu device,
      this release supports use on the ARM Cortex-M4 (IPU) and ARM Cortex-A15 (MPU).

    </p>
    <p>
      The Network Development Kit Support Package (NSP) contains
      Ethernet driver code, libraries and network examples for the supported EVM platforms.

      Information</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The method for registering a stack with the NSP driver has changed and is now done via a number of separate IOCTLs.
      The GMACSW_registerNetworkStack(), GMACSW_unregisterNetworkStack(), GMACSW_startNetworkStack(), and GMACSW_stopNetworkStack() APIs were removed.
      The test app shows proper use of the IOCTLs for opening channels and setting up priority mapping.

      The required versions of many dependencies have been updated for this release. See below.

    <p>
      The NSP includes demonstration software which showcases the various devices
      and cores and their capabilities across a range of network enabled applications, using
      the SYS/BIOS 6.x RTOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NDK examples found in this NSP can serve as a rapid prototype platform
      for the development of network and packet processing applications, or to add
      network connectivity to existing applications for communications,
      configuration, and control. Using the components provided in the NDK and NSP,
      developers can quickly move from development concepts to working
      implementations attached to the network.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="Testing" id="Testing">Testing</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The NSP includes a unit test client and server programs in the utils directory.
      This test program was used to validate the NSP. The test results that were generated
      by the test client/server are available <a href="packages/ti/nsp/drv/reports/test_report.html">here</a>.
      Note that any results which show FAIL purely due to CRC errors, are not true failures of the NSP, but 
      rather are indicative of some physical transport issue between the two MACs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To rerun the NSP tests you need to build the test client on a Linux workstation
      (tested on Ubuntu 12.04) with a gigabit Ethernet NIC. The Linux OS must support
      the use of the hierarchial token bucket (HTB) queueing discipline (qdisc). The
      test program makes use of the 'tc' utility to manipulate traffic shaping on the
      Linux PC (to do rate limiting of streams). There are CCS projects for NSP test
      server for each supported platform and core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The test setup used a dedicated connection between the Linux workstation and the
      device under test, with both end configured to use static IP addresses on the 192.168.1.x
      subnet. No switch was used between the two endpoints. If you wish to use DHCP for dynamic
      addressing on your network, you will need to update the server project's config file (nsp_test_server.cfg)
      and change the 'enableStaticIP' variable at the top of the file to 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testing procedure is as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>Import and build the server CCS project appropriate for the device and core you wish to test. Note: all tests done using release builds.</li>
        <li>Use the make utility to build the client program on the Linux workstation
        <ol>
          <li>Copy the utils/nsp_test directory to the Linux machine.</li>
          <li>Enter the utils/nsp_test/client path.</li>
          <li>Run 'make all' to build the NSP test client.</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>Load and run the server executable on the target device/core. For the J5Eco and Centaurus platforms, Gel files for the A8 cores are included in the
        NSP package under the packages/ti/ndk/j5eco and packages/ti/ndk/centaurus directories. For the Vayu device, you should use the standard Gel files provided.
        For executing on the M3 (J5Eco or Centaurus Media Controller) or M4 (Vayu IPU1), you need to connect to the Cortex A8/A15 core first and then connect to the
        M3/M4 core.</li>
        <li>With the server running, execute the client application on the Linux machine. For the test setup used to generate the results included, the following
        command was used:<p><code>sudo ./nsp_test_client --ip 192.168.1.200 --dev eth1 --num-load-measures 0 --num-shutdowns 5 --run-perf-tests true --test-duration 30</code></p>
        Note that using root or elevated privileges is required because the program uses raw sockets. If you do not use the static IP address option, you will need to use
        the IP address printed when you first start executing the server application under CCS. The Ethernet device used may also be different (eth0 is probably most common).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
