/**

  @struct FILTER_2D_CreateParams
  @brief  This structure contains all the parameters which controls
          2D filter applet at create time

  @param  visionParams
          Common parmeters for all ivison based modules

  @param imageFormat
          Image format for the input buffers used. Refer FILTER_2D_TI_ImageFormat
          for valid valies

  @param  filterCoefWidth
          Width of the filter coefficient mask

  @param  filterCoefHeight
          Height of the filter coefficient mask

  @param  filterCoef
          Pointer Pointing to filter coefficients array of  filterCoefWidth x filterCoefHeight.
          For separable filter first filterCoefWidth elements will corrresponds to filter
          in Horizontal direction and last filterCoefHeight elements will corrresponds to filter
          in Vertical direction

  @param  separableFilter
          A value of 1 indicates filter is separable and 0 indicates its non-separable.
          Current Implementation is only for separable filter

@param  enableContrastStretching
        A value of 1 will enable contrast stretching for Y component of image.

@param  enableFilter
        A value of 1 will enable filter and 0 will disable filter operation. It is important to note that
        this will not have same performance as for the case when only contrast stretching alone done.
        The reason is that when we disable filer we still call the filter kernel with coefficients equal to 1.


@param minVal
        This parameter is only used when enableContrastStretching = 1. This is the minimum
        pixel value to be used for stretching the contrast

@param maxVal
        This parameter is only used when enableContrastStretching = 1. This is the maximum
        pixel value to be used for stretching the contrast

@param minPercentileThreshold
        This parameter is only used when enableContrastStretching = 1. This is the
        percentage to pixels used to determine the minimum value from histogram. For
        example a value of 1 means while calculating the minimum value of histogram we will
        find the minimum value which is greater than 1% of pixels

@param maxPercentileThreshold
        This parameter is only used when enableContrastStretching = 1. This is the
        percentage to pixels used to determine the maximum value from histogram. For
        example a value of 99 means while calculating the maximum value of histogram we will
        find the maximum value which is lessor than 99% of pixels
