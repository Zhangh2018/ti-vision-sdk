/**
 * @par Description:
 *         The Kalman filter is implemented as two separate functions, one for
 * the time update (or prediction) and the other for the measurement update
 * (or correction). This implementation assumes a pre-determined fixed dimension
 * for the observation and state vectors. The observation vector should be of
 * dimension 2x1,and the state vector should have dimension 4x1.
 * The state of the Kalman filter is defined using the following structure.
 * The expected bit precision for each matrix is noted in the comments.
 * The variable sD and mD represent the dimensionality of the state and
 * measurement vectors and have values of 4 and 2 respectively
 * @verbatim
