  not enough buffer. It is important to note that for the cases when buffer is not sufficient this applet
  behavior is undefined.

            User can enable masking by separately providing a byte mask buffer with

          User can enable suppression of the list  by setting the value of this parameter to be 1. If list suppression is enable
          then based on user defined method itnernally we will uniformly downsample the image to reach the number of points
