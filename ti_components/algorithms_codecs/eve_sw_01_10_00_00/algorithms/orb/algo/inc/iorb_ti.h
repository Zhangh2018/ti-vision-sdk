@brief 
  Since there is a limitation of number of Key points in the function chain after 
  corner detetct can handle. It is 2K per level after Fast9 corner detection and 
  then across level for the input of Harris best feature, the sum across all levels 
  has to be less than or equal to 2K.
  So after fast9 corner detect if the points are more than 2K then we need to 
  reduce the point. There are 2 mechanism to reduce: 
  (1) Pickup first 2K in the list - ORB_FAST9_CORNERS_INITIAL
  (2) Iteratively increase the fast9 threhold till it reaches a stage when points 
  are  < 2K - ORB_FAST9_CORNERS_ITERATIVE. This scheme is not advisable as it may 
  impact the performance if there are multiple iterations to reach the required
  key points

  @struct ORB_TI_CreateParams
  @brief  This structure contains all the parameters which controls
          ORB algorithm at create time

  @param  visionParams
          Common parmeters for all ivison based modules

  @param  imgFrameWidth
          Width in bytes for the input image of highest level

  @param  imgFramePitch
          Pitch in bytes for the input image of highest level

  @param  imgFrameHeight
          Height in bytes for the input image of highest  level

  @param  numLevels
          Total number of pyramid levels including base level (1 means only base resolution)

  @param  fast9Threshold
          Threshold on difference between intensity of the central pixel and pixels
          of a circle around this pixel for FAST9 corner detect applet.

  @param  startX
          X co-ordinate of the first (top-left) pixel in the image. Useful for a ROI processing
          in a bigger image. Though the information about ROI is supplied via iVISION buf
          desc but create time also this information is required as this algorithm use the XY
          value as some create time initialization. It is for base level only.
          
  @param  startY
          Y co-ordinate of the first (top-left) pixel in the image. Useful for a ROI processing
          in a bigger image. Though the information about ROI is supplied via iVISION buf
          desc but create time also this information is required as this algorithm use the XY
          value as some create time initialization. It is for base level only

  @param  harrisSensitivityParam
          Value of sensitivity parameter (known as kappa in literature) for Harris score. 
          The format of this is Q1.15. Which means for a value of 0.04 you should 
          set 0.04*pow(2,15) =~ 1310

  @param  bestNFeaturesOut
          Total number of features to be generated across all levels

  @param  orbPattern
          This pattern defines the position of 256 pairs of src and dst to create 256 bit 
          rBRIEF descriptor. Total size of this memory are has to be 256*4. 
          For Exact format of this pattern - 
          256 bytes - X offset from center in src
          256 bytes - X offset from center in dst
          256 bytes - Y offset from center in src
          256 bytes - Y offset from center in dst
